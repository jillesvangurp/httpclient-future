# Introduction

**Update** I've been asked to integrate the functionality for this project into httpclient. The code for this is available in [httpclient 4.3](http://hc.apache.org/). The relevant class is called [FutureRequestExecutionService](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/tutorial/html/advanced.html#d5e936) and it includes most of the relevant functionality that is provided by this project.


**Because of this, I will likely not make any further commits to this repository.**
